 Features
=============
I live in an Ice Plains biome, and I wanted a plugin that was simple as possible to stop Glowstone from melting the snow in my house. I found a few on BukkitDev, but they did other things, too, or they implemented on/off commands.
So, voila: no configurations. No commands. No permissions. Install, and Glowstone won't melt anything. Uninstall, and Glowstone will melt things again. That's all, folks!
